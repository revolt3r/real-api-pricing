# Provider SVG assets

`ProviderLogo` discovers `*.svg` and `*.webp` here at build time and inlines them as data URLs, so the page, the SVG chart and exported files all carry the artwork without extra requests. Artwork is shown at 20–28 CSS pixels next to the model name. Third-party access shows the channel followed by the model developer. In dark mode, marks drawn in near-black ink (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Meituan) are recoloured to light ink; brands that ship an official dark variant (Kimi, Devin, OpenCode, SpaceXAI, Cursor, Ollama) use a bundled `<slug>-dark.svg` or `<slug>-dark.webp` instead; tile logos keep their own background.

## Files

openai, anthropic, claude, xai, cursor.webp, cursor-dark.webp, factory, kimi, kimi-dark, zhipu, minimax, alibaba, opencode, opencode-dark, xai-dark, deepseek, google, command-code, ollama, ollama-dark.webp, xiaomi, tencent, meta, microsoft, meituan, stepfun, devin, devin-dark.

Alibaba uses the Qwen mark; Tencent uses Hunyuan; Meituan uses LongCat; Google uses the official G. Factory uses its official near-black tile in both themes; no official light tile exists. Cursor uses its official square avatars — dark tile for light theme, light tile for dark theme. Ollama keeps the bare llama mark for light theme and ships the official white tile for dark theme. Muse Spark uses the Meta mark. Step models use the StepFun five-square mark. Devin (channel) and Cognition (SWE models) both use the official Devin mark. Third-party rows show the reseller first, then the model manufacturer.

## Sources

Most marks are from [lobehub/lobe-icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons) (MIT). Xiaomi is from [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) (CC0). Factory uses the official [factory.ai favicon](https://factory.ai/favicon.svg) (#020202 tile, #FAFAFA mark). Cursor uses the official cursor-brand-assets Avatars/Square 2D (`AVATAR_SQUARE_2D_DARK.png` / `AVATAR_SQUARE_2D_LIGHT.png`), resized to 128px WebP. Ollama's dark tile is the official `apple-touch-icon` from ollama.com. Alibaba uses the official Qwen blue mark cut from the chat.qwen.ai lockup. MiniMax uses the official Brand VI (2026-09-14) vector, with the gradient rebuilt as #E21680 → #FF633A. OpenCode is cut from the opencode.ai/brand ornate logo, in light and dark variants. Command Code uses the official commandcode.ai/brand symbol SVG. Zhipu uses the official z.ai `zai-logo.svg`. SpaceXAI uses the official SpaceXAI squared symbol tiles, unmodified — the black tile (`spacexai - symbol - white - squared`) for light theme, the white tile (`spacexai - symbol - black - squared`) for dark theme; xAI rebranded to SpaceXAI in July 2026. StepFun uses the official five-square mark; the circle gradient is sampled from the current public avatar (lime #67FBB1 → aqua #00F4E5 → cyan #1ACDEE). Chart solid color is the mid aqua #00F4E5. Kimi uses the official Kimi Logomark tile from the Kimi brand kit — the Light variant (black tile) for light theme, the Dark variant (white tile) for dark theme. Devin uses the official Devin mark from the Devin design system — dark-ink and white variants.

Brand marks remain trademarks of their owners. Rebuild recipe: `_assemble.py` (expects a `_fetch/` cache of upstream SVGs).

Prefer SVG assets without embedded rasters or scripts. Keep gradient IDs unique within each SVG.
